## About this Stories collection

This collection  will feature stories from archives of the Dutch East India Company. These visual essays aim to highlight interesting stories unearthed from the archives, giving voice to previously silenced historical actors and processes. These stories drawn from the archives will be complemented with visual and material sources from other digital collections. 

This initiative is being developed by the [GLOBALISE project](https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/), Huygens Institute, KNAW, the Netherlands.
